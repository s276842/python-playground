    "# Reactive Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactive programming describes a design paradigm that relies on asynchronous programming logic to handle real-time updates to otherwise static content. A reactive application must be;\n",
    "- **Responsive** takes action in a timely manner\n",
    "- **Resilient** can handle failures and keep working \n",
    "- **Elastic** The system stays responsive under varying workload\n",
    "- **Message Driven**  Reactive Systems rely on asynchronous message-passing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observer Pattern\n",
    "The *Observer-Observable* pattern, which ensures that a group of objects gets alerted whenever another object's state changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observable** notifies other objects of a change in the state\n",
    "- **Observer** receive the notification and apply the suited work\n",
    "\n",
    ">To receive the notifications the Observer must *subscribe* to the Observable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observables\n",
    "Based on their behaviour, Observables can be distinguished into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *cold Observables*: they publish data only if at least one Observer is subscribed. The data is queued into a Data Stream (pull relation)\n",
    "- *hot Observables*: they publish data independenlty of the number of Observers. As soon as an Observer is subscribed, it will start to receive data (from that point on).\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the case of hot Observables data can be lost. This approach is typically used when data is irrilevant if not processed immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "## ReactiveX\n",
    "The most well-known implementation of the Reactive Programming paradigm is ReactiveX. It's built on the *Observer-Observable*.\n",
    "The implemented library for python is the RxPy.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import rx\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An Observable can be created to publish data from static data and dynamic data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "observable = rx.from_list([1,2,3,4,5])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An Observer can be *subscribed* using the `subscribe` method:\n",
    "```\n",
    "subscribe(observer=None, on_error=None, on_completed=None, on_next=None, *, scheduler=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `observer` The object that is to receive notifications.\n",
    "- `on_error` Action to invoke upon exceptional termination of the observable sequence.\n",
    "- `on_completed` Action to invoke upon graceful termination of the observable sequence.\n",
    "- `on_next` Action to invoke for each element in the observable sequence.\n",
    "- `scheduler` The default scheduler to use for this subscription.\n"
